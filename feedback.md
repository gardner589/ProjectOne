# Project 1 Evaluation
[inline code comments](https://github.com/gardner589/ProjectOne/pull/1/files)
## Planning / Process / Submission
**0: Incomplete**
>No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc)

I don't see any documentation! Let me know if you end up adding a readme, wireframe, etc. and I'll take another look.

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

Great job here. With the exception of a bug that allows you to click more than twice in a turn, this is a fully-functional Concentration game. Take a look at my inline code comments (link above) for some additional thoughts.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

Your code is pretty readable but there are a few steps you can take to improve on this front. One is to give all your variables semantic names -- naming them `c` or `x` doesn't tell you what their purpose is. Also break down long blocks of code into smaller parts. This might mean just adding comments describing what each part does. Or it might mean that you would benefit from encapsulating certain pieces of functionality into their own functions. I think those things together will go a long way in improving your JS here.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Very rad theme. Had some serious Marvel vs. Capcom vs. Whatever arcade flashbacks. Keep it up.
